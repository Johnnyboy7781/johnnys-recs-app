# Johnny's Recs 😋

The frontend that consumes data from [Johnny's Recs Service](https://github.com/Johnnyboy7781/johnnys-recs-service)!

An Angular app that provides the user with a list of my food and drink recommendations for a given region. Uses Express.js as a web server.

Visit the app at https://www.JohnnysRecs.com.

## Running Locally

To run locally, follow these steps:

1. Run `npm i` to download dependencies.
2. Run [```npm run dev```] to start the local server.

Your application will then be available at [`http://localhost:4200`](http://localhost:4200).  
That's it! 🎉
